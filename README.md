# Capstone-project-Framigham-Heart-study
Predicting Ten-year Coronary Heart Disease- The dataset provides the risk factors associated with heart disease for ~4200 patients and whether they have a risk of coronary heart disease in the next 10 years
Main Objectives were
Create a segmentation of the patients based on the demographic, behavioural and health data and analyse the risk propensity of heart disease for each segment
Predict the probability of a patient suffering a coronary heart disease in the next 10 years
Identify the most important factors that influence heart disease
Come up with recommendations for
a)Preventing / reducing chances of getting a heart disease
b)Extrapolated applications of the model you build and its findings

Logistic regression and Random forest came closest to achieve desired accuracy

Besides the 5 models initially chosen, other few models were also attempted but results of Log regression were generally better
